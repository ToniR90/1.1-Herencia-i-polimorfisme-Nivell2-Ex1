# 1.1-Herencia-i-polimorfisme-Nivell2-Ex1

📄 Description - Exercise Statement
This project implements a hierarchy of classes and interfaces to work with the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

Objective of the Exercise:
1. Create a class named `Phone` with the attributes `brand` and `model`, and a method `call()` that receives a phone number as a parameter and displays a message on the console.
2. Define two interfaces: `Camera` with a method `photo()` and `Clock` with a method `alarm()`.
3. Create a subclass `Smartphone` that inherits from `Phone` and implements the `Camera` and `Clock` interfaces.
4. From the `main()` method, create an object of `Smartphone` and call the methods defined above.
